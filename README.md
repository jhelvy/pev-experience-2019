# pev-experience-2019

This repo contains the data and code to reproduce results from the PEV ride along experiment we conducted with EZEV at the 2019 DC autoshow held April 5 - 14, 2019.

To reproduce the result, install [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/), then open the "project.Rproj" file. All of the figures can be reproduced using the code in the "code/figures.R" file. The models can be estimated using the "code/models_fit.R" file. Finally, tests of how well the models fit the data can be run using the "code/models_test.R" file.
